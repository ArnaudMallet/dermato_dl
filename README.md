# Dermatologist AI

**Excellent** mini-project presented by _Sebastien Thrun_

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository and create a data/ folder to hold the dataset of skin images.

'Git clone https://github.com/udacity/dermatologist-ai.git'
'mkdir data ; cd data'

2. Download and unzip the training data (5.3 GB).

3. Download and unzip the validation data (824.5 MB).

4. Download and unzip the test data (5.1 GB).
